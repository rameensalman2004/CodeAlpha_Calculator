This project is a fully functional, browser-based scientific calculator built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, offering a robust tool for a wide range of mathematical computations. It features a clean, responsive interface that performs both standard arithmetic and advanced scientific functions like trigonometry, logarithms, and factorials. Key features include a persistent calculation history sidebar, memory and a theme selector with multiple options (e.g., Dark, Light) that saves the user's preference to localStorage. The application is fully responsive and offers comprehensive keyboard support, allowing for both direct input and arrow key navigation. The core logic is encapsulated in an ES6 ScientificCalculator class that handles all DOM manipulation and calculations, while modern CSS3, is used to create the polished, themeable, and mobile-friendly user interface.
